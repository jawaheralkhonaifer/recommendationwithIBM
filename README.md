# üìö Software Engineering for Data Scientists  
**Final Project ‚Äì Recommendation System on IBM Watson Platform**

This repository contains the final project for the *Software Engineering for Data Scientists* course. The goal of the project is to build a recommendation system using real user interaction data from the IBM Watson Studio platform.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed interactions between users and articles on the IBM Watson platform. Based on the insights, I built a recommendation engine to suggest relevant articles to users. The project explores several recommendation techniques, including rank-based, collaborative filtering, content-based methods, and matrix factorization.
